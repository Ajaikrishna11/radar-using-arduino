# Radar_mini_Project
 Our college conducts a MICRO expo, where we ECE students all are supposed to do a mini project,so we made a simple mini project with radar and arduino.
Title: Radar: Object Detection Visualization using Arduino and IR Sensor

# Introduction:
Radar is an Arduino-based project  that provides a visually engaging solution for object detection using an IR sensor.The project displays a screen filled with green color, scanning a 180-degree area from left to right in a periodic motion. When an object is detected within the scanning range, a red-colored area is displayed on the screen, indicating the presence of the detected object. This passage highlights the project's features, components, and GitHub repository for further exploration.

# Components:
1. Arduino Uno: The Arduino Uno board serves as the central controller for receiving data from the IR sensor and controlling the output display.
2. IR Sensor: An infrared sensor is employed to detect objects within its scanning range. It emits and receives infrared signals to determine the presence of objects.
3. Display Screen: The output visualization is presented on a screen, which is initially filled with green color. When an object is detected, a red-colored area is displayed on the screen, highlighting the object's shape.

# Functionality:
The Radar project operates as follows:
1. The IR sensor emits and receives infrared signals in a 180-degree scanning range.
2. The Arduino Uno receives the data from the IR sensor and processes it.
3. Based on the detection result, the Arduino Uno controls the display screen.
4. The screen is initially filled with green color, representing no detected objects.
5. When an object is detected within the scanning range, a red-colored area is displayed on the screen, representing the detected object's shape.
6. The scanning motion from left to right is repeated periodically, providing continuous object detection and visualization.

# GitHub Repository:
The Radar project's GitHub repository includes the complete source code and relevant documentation, offering a valuable resource for learning and experimentation. The repository is organized as follows:

# 1. Code Folder:
   - Main Folders: This file contains the Arduino sketch responsible for receiving data from the IR sensor, processing it, and controlling the display screen.

# 2. Documentation Folder:
   - README.md: This document provides detailed instructions for setting up and running the project. It includes guidance on connecting the components, uploading the code to the Arduino Uno, and understanding the scanning and visualization process.
   - Circuit Diagram: A visual representation of the circuit connections required to assemble the project.
   - Component List: A detailed list of all the required components, along with their specifications.

# Conclusion:
Radar, an Arduino-based project utilizing an IR sensor for object detection visualization, offers an engaging way to explore the world of electronics and Arduino programming. By displaying a screen filled with green and periodically scanning a 180-degree range, the project effectively visualizes the presence of detected objects through a red-colored area on the screen. The GitHub repository associated with the project provides a comprehensive resource for learners, offering code, documentation, and guidance necessary to understand and replicate the functionality. Whether you're an electronics enthusiast, a student, or a hobbyist, Radar presents an exciting opportunity to delve into the fascinating realm of object detection visualization using Arduino and IR sensors.
